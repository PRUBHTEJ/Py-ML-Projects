# Screenshot App


## This is a GUI enbled screenshot taking app.


The following libraries were imported to execute this project:
1. time
2. tkinter
3. PyAutoGUI

(All these libraries can be imported using ```pip3 import <lib_name>```)

I used Ubuntu 20.04 to run this application, on which it ran successfully without any lag.
