# Face Recognition using harcascade classifier

This is one of the basic projects that I have implememted while learning Python from coding blocks. 

In this project, I have used the pre-trained harcascade classifier for face recognition, Python 3.7 & the OpenCv (CV2) library for the implementation. For those who want 
to download OpenCV can download it via `pip install cv2`.
